#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡
# my own answer also good:

# if year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0):
#     print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
# else:
#     print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")

if year % 4 == 0:
    if year % 100 == 0:
        if year % 400 == 0:
            print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
        else:
            print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")
    else:
        print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
else:
    print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")
